# Tic-Tac-Toe
This simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features a 3x3 grid where two players click to alternate between "X" and "0". Each box can be clicked twice before being disabled. The game includes a reset button to clear the grid, and its minimalist design offers a clean, responsive user experience.
