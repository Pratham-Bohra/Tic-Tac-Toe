# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to alternate turns by clicking on boxes in a 3x3 grid. The game includes basic interaction logic for placing "X" and "0" in each box and a reset button to clear the grid.

## Features
- **Grid Layout**: The game is structured as a 3x3 grid, where players can click boxes to place "X" or "0".
- **Toggle X and 0**: The boxes toggle between "X" and "0" with each click. Once a box is clicked twice, the interaction for that box is disabled.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button is provided to clear the grid and start a new game.
- **Interactive Styling**: The grid and buttons are styled for an engaging user experience with a clean and responsive layout.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The structure of the game board, containing buttons that represent each box and a reset button.
- **style.css**: The stylesheet that defines the layout, colors, and styling of the game board and buttons.
- **tic.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for player interaction, toggling between "X" and "0", and resetting the game.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any of the 9 boxes in the grid to place an "X" or "0".
3. Once a box has been clicked twice, it cannot be clicked again until the reset button is pressed.
4. Click the reset button to clear the grid and start a new game.

## Technologies Used
